    /**
     * \brief
     *  Instances of this class can be used to interface with a PS2 keyboard.  This class does not
     *  decode the keystroke protocol, but rather provides the data from the keyboard in a raw form.
     *  You either need to write code that directly understands what the PS2 is providing, or use
     *  one of the provided translator classes (e.g. \ref AnsiTranslator).
     *
     * \tparam DataPin The pin number of the pin that's connected to the PS2 data wire.
     * \tparam ClockPin The pin number of the pin that's connected to the PS2 clock wire.  This
     *                  pin must be one that supports interrupts on your board.
     * \tparam BufferSize The size of the internal buffer that stores the bytes coming from the
     *                    keyboard between the time they're received from the ClockPin-based
     *                    interrupts and the time they're consumed by calls to \ref readScanCode.
     *                    If you are calling that method very frequently (many times per millisecond)
     *                    then 1 is enough.  Expect each keystroke to eat about 4 bytes, so 16
     *                    can hold up to 4 keystrokes.  There's nothing wrong with larger numbers,
     *                    but you probably want some amount of responsiveness to user commands.
     * \tparam Diagnostics A class that will record any unpleasantness that befalls your program
     *                     such as the aforementioned buffer overflows.  This is purely a debugging
     *                     aid.  If you don't need to be doing any debugging, you can stick wit the
     *                     default, \ref NullDiagnostics, which has no-op implementations for all the
     *                     event handlers.  The C++ compiler will optimize empty implementations
     *                     completely away, so you pay no penalty for having this debug code in your
     *                     project if you don't use it.  The \ref SimpleDiagnostics implementation
     *                     provides an implementation that records all the events.
     *
     * \details
     *  A great source of information about the PS2 keyboard can be found here: http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2keyboard/.
     *  This documentation assumes you have a basic grasp of that.
     *
     *  Most programs will use this class like this:
     *
     * \code
     * static ps2::Keyboard<4,2> ps2Keyboard(diagnostics);
     *
     * void setup() {
     *   ps2Keyboard.begin();
     *   ps2Keyboard.reset();
     *   // more keyboard setup if needed (e.g. set the scan code set)
     * }
     *
     * void loop() {
     *   ps2::KeyboardOutput scanCode = ps2Keyboard.readScanCode();
     *   if (scanCode != ps2::KeyboardOutput::none) {
     *     respondTo(scanCode);
     *   };
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     *  In this example, the keyboard is wired up with the data pin connected to pin 4 and
     *  the clock pin connected to pin 2.  The setup function should start up the keyboard.
     *  In many cases, you really don't have to do anything other than call 'begin' to get
     *  going.  Here, it calls 'reset' to undo whatever mode the keyboard might already be in.
     *  In the real world, this is unlikely to ever be necessary, but there you are.  A more
     *  likely move would be to set the keyboard up in the PS/2 scan code set and perhaps
     *  disabling typematic or enabling unmake codes to make it easier to interpret the
     *  keyboard's protocol.
     *
     *  You should poll the keyboard from your loop implementation, as illustrated here.
     *
     *  With all things Arduino, you should understand the performance.  \ref readScanCode takes
     *  only a few machine instructions to complete.  The methods that push data to the keyboard
     *  take longer (on the order of milliseconds) because of the handshake between the two
     *  devices and the throttling of sending one bit at a time at 10KHz.
     *
     *  All of the keyboard setup methods return a bool that reports success or not; you can
     *  test them if you feel it necessary, but few applications will really need to.
     *
     *  The biggest source of legitimate error is long-running interrupts which cause
     *  the PS2 clock interrupt to be skipped.  The response to the clock pin must be swift
     *  and consistent, else you'll get garbled messages.  The protocol is just robust
     *  enough to know that a failure has happened, but not robust enough to fully recover.
     *  If you're going to have another interrupt source in your project, see to it that
     *  its interrupt handler is as quick as possible.  For its part, the PS2 handler is
     *  just a few instructions in all cases.
     *
     *  If you supply an OnReceivedFunctor, then the operator() method of the object will be called
     *  each time a code is seen on the output line that is not been requested by this class itself.
     *  (That is, if a key is pressed, it'll get called for the bytes associated with that, but if
     *  you call the method to set the LED, the Ack code that the keyboard sends back does not generate
     *  a call.

         *  \details
         *    All this function does is wait for a proscribed amount of time (750ms, as suggested by
         *    the documentation), for a batSuccessful code.  That's straightforward.  The thing to be
         *    careful of is this - if you call this function in your begin() and then upload the program
         *    to your Arduino, all this is going to do is delay for 750ms and then throw a diagnostic
         *    code - that's because the keyboard has power throughout the event and so doesn't power-on.
         *
         *    But once you get your device into the field, you really can count on the proper behavior
         *    (well, unless you have, say, a reset button that resets the Arduino).
         *
         *    There are two reasonable ways to deal with this - first, if you need to set up the keyboard,
         *    e.g. set up a scan code set and all that, you need to call this method before you get up to
         *    your shennanigans - the keyboard just won't respond until it's done booting.  If that's you,
         *    and you're keen on having Diagnostic data, you can call \ref SimpleDiagnostic::reset right
         *    after this to clean it up.  If you're really keen on diagnostics, then you'll set up a
         *    "RELEASE" preprocessor symbol and skip the reset when you compile in that mode.
         *
         *    If you don't actually need to do any setup, then you can just skip calling this method.  Yes,
         *    the keyboard will send that batSuccessful (hopefully) signal later on, but \ref readScanCode
         *    specifically looks for that code and drops it on the floor when it arrives.
