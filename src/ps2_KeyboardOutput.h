     *    Entries prefixed by "sc2" are from the standard "Scan Code Set 2".
     *    Those with "sc2ex" are from the same set, but the ones that are prefixed with
     *    the 'extend' byte.  Entries prefixed by "sc3" are from the PS2 scan code set,
     *    which is far simpler, needing only one byte.  Being the simpler option, it is,
     *    of course, widely shunned.  Still, if you're building a device that's using an
     *    old ps2 keyboard to control it, you should strongly consider using that set.
