    /** \brief A basic recorder for events coming from the PS2 keyboard class library.
     *
     *  \details
     *
     *   It addition to recording events, it can also blink an LED when an error has been
     *   recorded.  It can dump its output to any print-capable class, such as the Serial port
     *   or a USB keyboard.
     *
     *   \section Usage Basic Usage
     *
     *   \code
     *    typedef ps2::SimpleDiagnostics<32> Diagnostics;
     *    static Diagnostics diagnostics;
     *    static ps2::Keyboard<4,2,1,Diagnostics> ps2Keyboard(diagnostics);
     *
     *    void loop() {
     *      diagnostics.setLedIndicator<LED_BUILTIN_RX, ps2::DiagnosticsLedBlink::heartbeat>();
     *      if ( <magic-user-gesture> ) {
     *        diagnostics.sendReport(Serial);
     *        diagnostics.reset();
     *      }
     *   \endcode
     *
     *   Each event is recorded as a series of one or more bytes in a circular queue.  The queue
     *   is meant to be read right-to-left, with the newest events at the right.  Thus if an
     *   event has multiple bytes in it, the extra bytes will be pushed onto the queue first.
     *   The last byte pushed contains the event ID and a count of the number of extra bytes.
     *   The number of extra bytes is in the lower two bits and the event ID in the upper 6.
     *   If the event ID is less than 16, it is taken to be an error.
     *
     *   There are two bytes reserved in the structure for storing all the errors that have
     *   happened since the recorder was last reset (as a bit-field).
     *
     *   \section Subclassing Subclassing
     *
     *    If you want to record events from other parts of your application, you can create a
     *    subclass that defines new events.  The Ps2ToUsbKeyboardAdapter example demonstrates
     *    how to do that:
     *
     *    \code
     *     class Diagnostics
     *         : public ps2::SimpleDiagnostics<254>
     *     {
     *       typedef ps2::SimpleDiagnostics<254> base;
     *       enum class UsbTranslatorAppCode : uint8_t {
     *         sentUsbKeyDown = 0 + base::firstUnusedInfoCode,
     *         sentUsbKeyUp = 1 + base::firstUnusedInfoCode,
     *       };
     *     public:
     *       void sentUsbKeyDown(byte b) { this->push((uint8_t)UsbTranslatorAppCode::sentUsbKeyDown, b); }
     *       void sentUsbKeyUp(byte b) { this->push((uint8_t)UsbTranslatorAppCode::sentUsbKeyUp, b); }
     *     };
     *    \endcode
     *
     *    Note that there are a maximum of 16 error identifiers and a maximum of 48 non-error identifiers.
     *
     *    \section AuthorsNote Author's Note
     *     Debugging and logging are often areas where we wish we could do more, but they can be
     *     infinite pits of labor if you let them.  Further, when neglected, the rest of the project
     *     becomes an infinite pit of labor...  There are two things I would wish for in the future:
     *     I wish it would store more data and, in particular, record the 10 keystrokes or
     *     other events before and after any error.  I would also like to see a website-based
     *     diagnostic data interpreter.
     *
     *  \tparam Size  The number of bytes to use for recording events.
