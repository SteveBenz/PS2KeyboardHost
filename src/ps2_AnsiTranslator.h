     *   the name "Ansi" is aspirational, as the implementation given here only works for
     *   English keyboards.
     *
     *  \details
     *   This will translate shift keys, caps lock, num lock and the ctrl key.  E.g. if the
     *   user types "Ctrl+G", \ref translatePs2Keycode will return Ascii 7.  If the caps lock
     *   key has been pressed before and the user types "g", it will return 'G'.  If the user
     *   types shift+H under these circumstances, it will return 'h'.
     *
     * \tparam Diagnostics A sink for debugging information.
